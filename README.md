# DiscordBot

This is a [discord](https://discord.com/) bot I made for fun so I can learn more about [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) the bot will be easy to use.
## Installation
To install this you will need [python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) after you have gotten python you can go into the project and do ``pip3 install -r requirements.txt`` to install all the necessary libraries needed. Then you would have to get the bot token you can make a discord bot by going to into [Discord developers](https://discord.com/developers/applications) after you have gotten your bot token you would have to make a .env file in the project after you have made it you can do ``TOKEN=tokenhere`` and you have your token set.
